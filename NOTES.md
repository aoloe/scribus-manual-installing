# Getting Scribus

## Getting the `.dmg`

https://www.scribus.net/downloads/stable-branch/

will send you to

https://sourceforge.net/projects/scribus/files/scribus/1.4.6/

where you can download

https://sourceforge.net/projects/scribus/files/scribus/1.4.6/scribus-1.4.6.dmg/download

(just don't click too much around, since sourceforge tends to show
"deceiving ads")

you then have a dmg that you can install as every other dmg...

## Homebrew

If you have Homebrew installed, you can use it instead of downloading the DMG.

## First launch of Scribus

 - Like most indipendent Software, the first time you open Scribus you have to right click on the application Icon and choose "Open".  
 Failing to do will give you a signature error.
 - On some os x versions, the first you run an application you did not get from the appstore, you have to right click on the application icon, choose open and confirm that you want to open the application you downloaded from the internets.

## Where is Ghostscript?

### You don't really need it. Mostly.

Suring your first steps with Scribus, you can probably safely ignore the message asking for
ghostscript.

The day you will need it, you will notice!

### Installing Ghostscript

You can download a DMG for Ghostscript from

http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/

Scribus should recognize it on the next start.

## Adding fonts
